This repository contains the tutorial that accompanies [this blog post](https://www.smalltownbigdata.com/post/steamboat-springs-land-cover-data-nlcd). 

This month, we're working in R. You can work in any code editor or IDE, but if you're a beginner, I recommend downloading [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). Code and instructions are available in the Feb2021-landcover.html file or at [this link](https://smalltownbigdata.github.io/feb2021-landcover/feb2021-landcover.html).
